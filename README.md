The R markdown file is the script for the analysis of tissue infiltrating immune cells in 17,265 breast tumours from 22 studies participating in the B-CAST project.

The data are available on the European genome Phenome Archive at https://ega

There are two linked data sets

**case_data.csv** is the clinical data set for 17,265 cases with a single row per case

site0		-		site variable used in ER neg analysis           
site1		-		site variable used in ER pos analysis          
study		-		study          
bcac_id  -  	unique identifier in BCAC database          
morphology	-tumour morphology          
age_diag	-	age at diagnosis          
enter			-	time from diagnosis to study entry          
fu_15		-		follow-up in years censored at 15                    
br_15		-		breast cancer death censored at 15 years          
grade		-		tumour grade          
size		-		tumour size (mm)          
nodes		-		number positive regional nodes          
er			-	  estrogen receptor status          
pr			-	  progesterone receptor status          
her2		-		her2 status          
er_ast		-	estrogen receptor automated score using astrogrid (see a)          
er_ari		-	estrogen receptor score using ariol


**tiic_scores.csv** is the automate scores for each tissues micro-array core across 4 markers.  There is one row per marker and core (n = 128,308).
This table has a many:1 relationship with the case data as there are multiple markers and some cases include more than 1 tumour core in TMAs

study	-			          study acronym          
bcac_id	-		          unique identifier in BCAC database          
core_id	-		          unique tissue micro-array core identifier          
core_size	-		        TMA core size          
marker	-		          IHC marker          
area_all_mn	-		      total tissue area from mininet algorithm          
area_stroma_mn	-	    total stromal tissue area from mininet algorithm          
area_tumour_mn 	-	    total tumour tissue area from mininet algorithm          
area_artefact_mn	-	  area of artefact from mininet algorithm        
area_all_til_halo	-  percentage of all tissue occupied by TIICs from halo algorithm        
area_stroma_til_halo -	percentage of stroma occupied by TIICs from halo algorithm        
area_tumour_til_halo	-percentage of tumour occupied by TIICs from halo algorithm


The third data set is derived from the two primary data sets

**imputed_data.csv** includes the merged non-imputed data and ten imputed data sets at each of six minimum area (mm2) thresholds for exclusion of core level data. 
Each data set at each threshold comprises one row per case with TIIC scores based on the mean value for multiple cores.
Thus the total number of rows is 1,139,490 - 17,265 cases x 11 imputed data sets x 6 thresholds.
